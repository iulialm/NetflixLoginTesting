This repository contains the final project for the accreditation of the Manual and Automated Software Tester course.
The project focuses on testing the login functionality on the Netflix platform. The test is conducted in PyCharm, based on Gherkin, where I have created 3 test scenarios:

1. Testing with invalid credentials;
2. Testing with a valid username and incorrect password; 
3. Testing with valid credentials.


To reproduce the test, you need:
Google Chrome;
PyCharm 3.12;
Selenium;
behave-html-formatter;
